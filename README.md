# GameVault

## Setup

Make a python venv (it might not be python3 on your machine, just whatever your global python install is called)

`python3 -m venv .venv`

^ Run this in the root directory of the project

Then run

`. .venv/bin/activate` (I think it's `. .venv/scripts/activate` on windows)

to run the venv.

Then install requirements by running 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
